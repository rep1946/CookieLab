# Cookie Recipe Lab

## Task

Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in [this](./index.html) HTML document (she's so nice). 

She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list).

Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style:

## Cookie Recipe CSS

- The background color for the page is #FFE
- The color for the text reading "Nutrition Information" is #887
- The link color is #900

Bonus: 

1. Put the cookies image in your HTML file, right under where it says "The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies"
2. Give the cookies image *and* the whole page a black border
